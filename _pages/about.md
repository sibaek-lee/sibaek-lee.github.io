Hi!ðŸ˜€ I am a PhD student in [Intelligent Robotics](https://robot.skku.edu/robot_en/index.do) at Sungkyunkwan University advised by Prof. [Hyeonwoo yu](https://bogus2000.github.io/) where I am a member of the Lab of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ([Lair](https://sites.google.com/view/hyeonwooyu/)). 

As a researcher, I hope my research contributes positively to society and I believe that artificial intelligence is a step towards achieving that goal. My research focuses on using deep learning techniques to enhance robots' spatial perception. By improving their ability to perceive their environment accurately, we can enable robots to make better decisions, perform more complex tasks, and ultimately help people in various ways. <br> <br> 



#### Research Interests
- **ðŸ§  Deep Learning:** 3D Vision, Vision Language Model, Generative model, Bayesian learning
- **ðŸ¤– Robotics:** Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Robot Perception and navigation
